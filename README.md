# Notion-Token_v2 Extractor
This is a extractor which automatically extracts the token_v2 cookies' value with practically no input from the user

*Note*
1. The user must already be logged into his/her Notion.so account 
2. This only works on Google chrome with user's default profile 
3. The token is saved into a .txt file
